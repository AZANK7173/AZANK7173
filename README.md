## :books: Projects
- **[Tennis Tracking - Image Analysis and Computer Vision project:](https://github.com/febagni/tennis-ball-tracker-computer-vision)** Project that, inputed a video of a tennins match, with normal TV view: tracks the path of the ball path, identify when a bounce occured, then it identifies the court, obtain its projection and maps exactly where the ball has bounced.
- **[Ventilation Estimation App (partnership with WHO):](https://github.com/AZANK7173/VentilationCalculator_App)** Flutter App that helps people discovering the infection risks of their environments. The user must provide, as input, the dimensions of their room and windows and the app will then use their location to obtain the rest of the data necessary to estimate the ventilation and air change of the place. This is finally compared to World Health Organization guidelines and it informs if changes in ventilation should be done.
- **[ARARA project - LLM for education:](https://github.com/febagni/Arara)** Streamlit application that receives PDF documents from lectures and uses GPT3.5 engine in order to create interactive questions and aid for students, without substitution of their critical thinking abilities.
- **[Polimi Small Projects:]([https://github.com/AZANK7173/Data_Science_Contents](https://github.com/AZANK7173/Polimi-Small-Projects-Repo))** Small projects developed during my Computer Science and Engineering Master's Degree. Theme range from: Deep Learning with CNNs and LSTMs, Data Quality and its techniques, Optimization algorithms and applications and Software Engineering.  
- **[Data Science Courses, Notebooks and Classes:](https://github.com/AZANK7173/Data_Science_Contents)** Data Science Contents that I developted at Turing USP. Including, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Time Series prediction, Model interpretability and much more. 
- **[Rotten Scrapper Application:](https://github.com/AZANK7173/Rotten_scrapping)** Real-Time Analysis application made by scrapping Rotten Tomatoes Movies (deployed on Streamlit).
- **[GraduatiON - Website for Undergrads:](https://github.com/GraduationOrganizationTeam/graduation-project)** Website developted with Django in order to create a safe space in which students and professor can interact and evaluate college level courses.
- **[Sage - IoT pill dispenser:](https://github.com/AZANK7173/Sage)** Code development of an IoT system that interacts with a pill dispenser in order to follow and control medicine disposability 
- **[Locaturing - Content based recomendation system for movies:](https://github.com/turing-usp/locaturing)** Application created with dash that makes movie recommendations based in a selected previous movie, the approach is content-based and done using string concatenation and cosine similarity. In the application, it is possible to choose the weights of each feature to consider in the decision (i.e Director, Cast, Theme, etc).
